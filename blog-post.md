# I Saw a Chinese App Go Viral — So I Built the Version the West Actually Needs

*By Siamak · January 2026*

---

In early January, a Chinese app called "Are You Dead?" started climbing app charts. A dead man's switch for people who live alone. Tap a button every day. Miss two days, your emergency contact gets notified.

I saw it and thought: *this is the app the Western market has been waiting for — but it needs a completely different approach.*

So I built one.

## The Signal

"Are You Dead?" was built for $210 by three developers in Shenzhen. Within three days it hit $14M valuation and #1 paid in China. BBC, CNN, Reuters, Wired, Guardian — every major outlet ran the story.

But here's what the coverage actually proved: **this isn't a novelty.** This is a universal human fear that 40 million Americans carry quietly every day.

I live alone sometimes when I travel. Last year, alone in a hotel in a city where nobody knew me, I got food poisoning bad enough to wonder: *if I pass out, who finds me?*

That question sits with you.

## Why I Didn't Just Download Demumu

I looked at what existed. All of it.

- **Demumu ("Are You Dead?")** — viral, clever, but built for the Chinese market with Chinese data policies. The name works as dark humor in China. In the US, your mom isn't downloading something called "Are You Dead?"
- **Life Alert** — $50/month, ugly hardware, designed for 80-year-olds. Not for a 35-year-old remote worker.
- **Family trackers** — share your GPS 24/7. Absolutely not.
- **Snug Safety** — $20/month, buries the core function under premium dispatch services.

The gap was obvious: **nobody built the Western version.** Privacy-first. Warm, not morbid. Designed for daily use, not a novelty download. Priced like it respects your intelligence.

## So I Built ImStillHere

Same core insight as Demumu. Completely different execution.

Open the app. Tap once: "I'm still here." Ten seconds. Done.

Miss 48 hours? Your chosen contact gets a calm notification: *"Hey, haven't heard from them in a while. Might want to check in."*

That's the entire product. And that's deliberate. Every feature I considered had to pass one test: *does this make the daily check-in take longer than 10 seconds?* If yes — killed it.

But where it matters, I went further than Demumu:

- **Activity Mode** — going on a solo hike? Set a timed check-in with a shorter window.
- **Pet Emergency Info** — first responders should know there's a cat in your apartment that needs care.
- **Flexible safety windows** — 24h, 48h, 72h. Your life, your schedule.
- **Privacy-first** — your data stays on your device. No tracking. No selling. No Chinese data policies to worry about.

## The Name Says Everything

"Are You Dead?" is a meme. It spikes. It fades. People download it for the joke, open it twice, forget about it.

"ImStillHere" is an emotion. It's the thing you whisper to yourself when you check in. It's warmth, not shock. It builds a daily habit, not a viral moment.

Demumu cracked virality. I'm building for retention. They got the spike. I'm playing for the long curve.

## The Market Is Screaming

The numbers aren't subtle:

- **40 million Americans** live alone — a record 29% of all households (Census Bureau)
- One-person households grew in **26 of 30 rich countries** since 2010
- Remote work isn't reversing. Solo living is accelerating.
- China has **125 million** one-person households, projected to reach **200 million by 2030**

Demumu proved the demand overnight. What it didn't prove is that the demand disappears when the meme fades. It won't. Because this isn't about an app going viral — it's about a demographic shift that's permanent.

## $4.99/Month. No Free Tier.

If you won't pay $5/month for someone to notice you're missing, you don't actually have this problem.

Life Alert charges $50+. Snug Safety charges $20. They need hardware, call centers, infrastructure.

I need a server and a push notification. That's why $4.99 works — and why I can build this solo.

## Built Solo, Shipped Fast

I'm one developer. No team. No funding. I built ImStillHere with AI tools in three weeks.

This is what indie development looks like in 2026. You see a signal (Demumu goes viral), you understand the gap (Western market, privacy, retention), and you ship before the wave passes.

The wave is still here. So am I.
