## 🔥 Viral Angle: Ride the "Are You Dead?" Wave

The Chinese app "Are You Dead?" just became the #1 paid app in China. It's making headlines globally. Still Here is the Western equivalent — same concept, better branding, privacy-focused.

### Press Pitch Template

**Subject:** The American Answer to China's Viral "Are You Dead?" App

Hi [Name],

You may have seen the recent coverage of "Are You Dead?" — the Chinese app that became the #1 paid app in China last week by solving a simple problem: letting people who live alone confirm they're okay with one tap.

I built Still Here to bring this concept to Western users, with a focus on privacy (data stays on device) and a less morbid name.

**The hook:** 36 million Americans live alone. Most share the same quiet fear: "What if something happens and no one notices for days?"

Still Here is dead simple:
- Tap once a day to confirm you're okay
- Miss 48 hours → your emergency contact is notified
- Free forever, no subscriptions

I'd love to share more about the story behind it and why this need is universal.

Best,
[Name]

### Launch Day Tweets

**Thread 1: The Story**
```
1/ I just launched Still Here - a dead simple app for people who live alone.

One tap daily = your loved ones know you're okay.

Miss 48 hours = your emergency contact is notified.

That's it. No subscription. Free forever.

Here's why I built it 🧵
```

```
2/ 36 million Americans live alone.

Most share the same quiet fear: "What if something happens and no one notices for days?"

This isn't paranoia. It happens. A lot.
```

```
3/ In China, an app called "Are You Dead?" just became the #1 paid app.

It does exactly what Still Here does. One button. One contact.

Turns out this need is universal.
```

```
4/ I wanted something simpler than Life Alert (hardware, expensive, feels "old").

Simpler than wellness apps (too many features, subscription fatigue).

Just: tap. That's the whole app.
```

```
5/ Features that matter:
- 🐾 Pet info (so responders know who needs care)
- 🏔️ Vacation mode (going off-grid? pause alerts)
- 🏃 Activity mode (hiking alone? set a timed check-in)

All optional. Core is still just: tap.
```

```
6/ Free forever. No ads. No premium tier.

If you live alone, or know someone who does:

stillhere.app

Peace of mind, one tap at a time.
```

### Standalone Tweets

```
The best product ideas solve problems so obvious you wonder why they don't exist already.

"App that tells someone if I go silent for 2 days" = obvious.

Yet somehow I couldn't find one that wasn't either:
- Medical equipment for elderly
- Bloated wellness app with 50 features

So I built it.
```

```
Indie hacker shower thought:

The #1 paid app in China right now is called "Are You Dead?"

It's a dead man's switch. One button.

Sometimes the best products are the simplest.
```

```
Living alone stats that surprised me:

- 36M Americans live solo
- 15% of global households are single-person
- Average age of solo dwellers is dropping (more young people)

This isn't a niche. It's a massive, underserved market.
```

### Engagement Tweets (Post These Over Time)

```
Hot take: Most "wellness apps" fail because they add complexity to your life instead of removing it.

I don't need an AI to analyze my mood.

I need someone to know if I stop responding for 2 days.
```

```
Product lesson from building Still Here:

The hardest part wasn't building the app.

It was resisting the urge to add more features.

"What if we add mood analytics?"
"What about a family dashboard?"
"Social features?"

No. One button. One purpose.
```

## 📊 Launch Metrics to Track

## 💰 Monetization (Future)

Keep core free forever. Potential premium:
- Family dashboard ($4.99/mo) - multiple contacts see status
- Priority SMS alerts ($2.99/mo) - SMS in addition to email
- Custom check-in intervals ($2.99/mo) - 24h instead of 48h

**Do NOT gate:**
- Basic check-in
- Single emergency contact
- Activity mode
- Vacation mode
