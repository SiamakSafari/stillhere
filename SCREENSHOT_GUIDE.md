## Notes for Siamak

1. **Priority:** Get 5 iPhone screenshots first (required for iOS launch)
2. **Quick Win:** Use Figma template for device frames

4. **Consistency:** Same style/colors across all screenshots
5. **Test:** Preview at thumbnail size before finalizing

The app UI is already clean - screenshots should be straightforward!
